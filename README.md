# Summary

This repository is a concept idea created with ARKit and iOS 12 to overlay digital information on a custom reference image.
The code is far from perfect and needs to be adjusted to the circumstances the user want to use it. It still lacks some generalization of the methods, and the methods for user interactions, I'm planning to implement them in the near future. It is still a prototype that I'm working on.

# What to expect from this

By loading your custom reference image and by providing the correct measurements of your image the application will spawn digital objects next to it such as profile picture, name, telephone, messages, twitter, etc ... you can check the screenshots down below for further information

# Future developments

The project will be further developed in order to be more generalized and provide a few user interactions to the user.
